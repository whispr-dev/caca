## You now have a comprehensive implementation of the CACA (Cellular Automata CryptAnalysis) library with the following key components:

- Core BitSequence Implementation - A robust class for handling bit sequences, providing conversions between byte and bit representations, and offering bitwise operations.
- CPU Feature Detection - A sophisticated detection system that identifies which SIMD instruction sets are available on the current CPU.
- SIMD Dispatcher - An intelligent dispatch system that selects the best available SIMD implementation at runtime.
- Cellular Automata Processor - The heart of the CACA system, implementing various CA rules (30, 82, 110, 150) with optimized SIMD execution paths.
- NIST Statistical Tests - A set of statistical tests from the NIST suite for analyzing randomness in bit sequences.
- Progress Monitoring System - A real-time progress tracking system with resource usage monitoring.
- Main Application - A command-line application that brings everything together.
- CMake Build System - A comprehensive build system for compiling the project.

## To use this codebase, simply organize the files according to the structure outlined in the CMakeLists.txt, build the project, and run the CACA application on encrypted data files.


## For additional development, you might consider:

- Adding more NIST statistical tests
- Implementing additional CA rules
- Optimizing the SIMD implementations for specific tests
- Creating visualization tools for the results

## The existing implementation is designed to be both performant and extensible, with clean separation of concerns and a modular architecture.
