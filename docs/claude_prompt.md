Fren, i'm uploading you some background reading for context: the GitHub README.md for the project, a coupla other docs for an overview of the project we'll be working on, the research paper that inspired it [`.pdf`], the results from the first run of very basic initial testing, and the structure of the codebase filing system. along with the first 14 files of the codebase i'll upload  
[due to limitations on file upload numbers i'll have to upload only 20 at a time so you can read these and familiarise yourself whilst you wait :)] so i'll get on with the uploading rn.

And btw, although you're obviously feelin' like super hot whizz c oder who can solve any computer-baqsed problem when it comes to programming, you're still gonna be patient and take it easy on me - i'm jst a learner so i need full code examples to be able to paste into my screen and stufy, no placeholders whatsoever and perferably full sections of code as artifacts that make sense as a whole entity not just random disconnected lines - you unn'erstand?
