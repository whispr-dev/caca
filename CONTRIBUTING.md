**How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?**
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue and provide the following information:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue
- Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain project quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solution
- Enable a sustainable system for project maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the [template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#coding-standards)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing
